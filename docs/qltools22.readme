This file updates the QLtools documentation to v2.2 from v1.6. Note
that I do not have access to v1.7 - v2.02 documentation (if any
exists). The fixes/enhancements noted below are changes from the v2.02
code.

Bug fixes/features in QLTOOLS 2.15.3
====================================

1. ED discs are now catered for from version 2.15.2 onwards.

2. ZeroSomeSectors() was doing nothing, now fixed. It zeros out 36 
   sectors on the floppy when formatting.
   
3. From 2.15.1 onwards, the code has had a bit of a refactoring. Indentation
   has been fixed, variable names are now a bit more meaningful etc. The
   disc info display has been improved, "magic" numbers removed. Sector size
   is no longer assumed to be 512 (ED floppies are 2048), etc.

Bug fixes/features in QLTOOLS 2.2
=================================

1. Format option now works

2. HD disks now work

3. Disk type QL5A/QL5B  recognition fixed.

4. Random number is written when formatted.

5. Update count is updated on write and delete

6. Intel cross compiler files XTc68/Lux68 have the file type and data
   size set.

7. When Unix files are written, directory specs are removed and
   any dots are replaced with '_'. DOS files have '.' replacement.
   This can be disabled using the -t option.

8. I/O errors (e.g. write protected disk) trapped.

9. Wildcard operation for write (under Unix).

10. TKII type overwrite messages option.

11. Segment fault (GPF) on map listing of disk with sub-directories
    fixed.

12. Range operations for read and delete.

13. Read-only operations allowed on write protected disks.

14. Problems writing files where the number of files was a multiple of
    8 fixed. (v2.01 got the directory pointers wrong, so 8 files would
    not be visible under QDOS). v2.1 got it wrong a different way :-).

15. QLTools sets correct file date and updates file version when
    writing.


QLTools v2.2 Commands
=====================

The full command options for QLTools are:

 qltools dev -opt <args>

where 
	dev is the device.

	/dev/xxxx for Unix, for example
	
	/dev/fd0H720 (dd), /dev/fd0H1440 (hd) for Linux
	fd=/dev/fd0H720
	hd=/dev/fd0H1440
	export fd
	export hd
	qltools $hd ..etc..

	This is a: or b: for DOS and siblings (NT,OS/2,Win95 etc)

	-opt <args> are command options.

-t	Toggles translation of foreign names to QDOS/SMS. Default is on.

-uN	Dump Cluster 'N' to stdout. N is 0-479 for dd, 0-959 for hd.

-d	Verbose directory listing

-dl	Verbose directory listing (includes deleted files)

-s	Short listing (suitable for Unix scripts)

-i	Return disk info

-m	Display disk map

-c	Display sector/cluster mapping table

-nX[-Y]	Copy file number X [to file no. Y inclusive] to stdout. See
	viewall.sh and qlcopy.pl scripts; the -n is optional if no
        other options are given.

-n file Copy file name 'file' to stdout

-W files
	Copy files to disk, no prompt for overwrite.
-w files
	Copy files to disk, prompt for overwrite, like TKII does.

	Wildcards are supported where the shell provides wildcard
        expansion (Unix).

-l      lists wild card files as written to QDOS disk (-w, -W).

-rX[-Y] Delete file number X [to file no. Y inclusive].

-r file Delete file name 'file'.

-xX N Set dataspace for file number X to N bytes

-x file N
	Set dataspace for file name 'file' to N bytes.

-fXd name
	Adds a QL format to a disk low-level formatted by DOS or Unix
	(Linux fdformat).
	Xd is dd for DD disk, hd for HD disks
	name is the volume name

Note the syntax for options -n,-r,-x. Where there is a space after the
option, then what follows is assumed to be a single file name. Where
the paramter follows immediately, it is assumed to be a file number or
range.

Qltools 2.1+ supports automatic setting of dataspace for executable
files as follows.

	Where the executable file has been created with a c68
	cross-compiler (XTc68 for DOS, OS/2 or NT, Lux68 for Linux),
	then the dataspace is set automatically in the file header.

	Where normal QL executables are copied from a QDOS disk,
	QLTools will append a XTc68 data block (8 bytes) to the end of
	the file. When the executable is copied back to a QL disk,
	then the dataspace is set from this block. Note that this
	means that such files will experience a one off growth of 8
	bytes. This minor increase in file size is considered
	preferable (at least by JH) to the loss of such information.

Examples
========

qltools $fd -W ~/tmp/*.c	Copies all *.c files from the tmp
				sub-directory to a DD ql disk.
				The . is stored as _, directory suffix
				if disgarded. Any existing file is
				overwritten.

qltools $fd -t -w *.h		Copies all *.h files to a HD ql disk.
				The . is stored as .
				User is prompted for overwrite.

qltools $hd -r10-15		Deletes file numbers 10 to 15
				(inclusive)

qltools $fd -fdd plugh		Formats QL DD disk with label "plugh"


qltools $fd file_txt		Copies QL file 'file_txt' to stdout

Disclaimer
==========

I have been able to test this mainly under Linux with DD disks. I know
it can read DD disks written by a real QDOS compatible system, but at
the time of writing, HD disks written by QLTools are untested on
genuine hardware. The Linux version is compiled with gcc. The DOS et
al version is a 16bit DOS image compiled with Watcom C/C++. It runs
under DOS/NT/OS2/Win95.

The authors are not responsible for any consequences of using this
software, including the complete loss of all your data. You use this
at your own risk.

Bugs
====

Doesn't handle hard sub-directories. As I think I've worked out how
these work, then the next release of QLtools may implement this.

Considers the update field at offset 0x10 to be a long word. It
appears that some disk drivers consider this to be short. This is a
feature.

Doesn't allow qdos/sms  file selection by wildcard, this would require
escaping from the Unix shell.

Doesn't allow wildcards in DOS and siblings. This is a limitation of
DOS et al.

Doesn't handle ED disks. This is not likely to be implemented.
