Changes from 1.0 to 1.1
=======================

- There are a couple of bugs corrected: (tanks to Paul Foley)

   1) When a file is deleted, QDOS only sets the top byte of the info
      in the map to 0xFD.
      1.0 assumes the entire 12 bit entry is set to 0xFDF, but the final F
      will probably not be there unless that block has never been used.

   2) 1.0 use read_block0() to read in the map block, but it assumes the
      map block is 3 sectors long, in sectors 0, 3 and 6.  This is normally
      the case, but it _can_ be changed (there is an 84-track formatting
      program around that forces 4 sector allocation blocks).  All you can
      guarantee is that the first sector will be sector 0.  What I would
      suggest is to load in sector 0, get the info in the first 96 bytes and
      then use the general read_block() routine to read the entire map.

   3) #define for Maximum allocation block, since if allocation block was >3
      this cause a "core dump".

   4) Another #define for Maximum number of sectors (not ever 1440).

   5) Use the "allocblock" variable for allocation blocksnumber (refer to 2)).

   6) Check for unexistent sectors in a file.

   7) Check if the disk is a QL disk (1.0 simply dump)

I think there are some bugs with 3) and 4) and 5), but I cannot try the code
(I have never seen any of these disks).

Changes from 1.1 to 1.2
=======================

   1) A little bug: now argfnum is a long int (problems with Turbo C)

   2) MS-DOS support !!!

   3) A bug with lwrd, now return a unsigned long int and is a new function.

   4) Eh eh eh a bug in the name of my city (Padova and NOT Pdaova :-)

Changes from 1.2 to 1.3
=======================

   1) MS-DOS is a brain damnaged system. Stdout was opened with CR/LF
      conversion and this cause damnages of binaries.

   2) Corrected a bug in floppy reset under MS-DOS.

Changes from 1.3 to 1.4
=======================

   1) "bleod" and "byeod" now are unsigned integers.

   2) "wrd()" take a unsigned char pointer and return a unsigned int. There
      are some problems with directories. Now in wrd() are some type
      conversions.

Changes from 1.4 to 1.5
=======================

   1) Apple Mac adaption by Roberto Avanzi <gandalf@sabrina.dei.unipd.it>

   2) patches by Scott Telford <st@epcc.edinburgh.ac.uk>
      - Improved error messages
      - Qdos level 2 device subdirectories (file type 255) are now
        recognised in the directory listing (indicated by a "->" like
        the level 2 WSTAT.
      - Unrecognised file types have their type number printed.
      - Empty directory entries (length=0) are skipped in the directory
        listing.

Changes from 1.5 to 1.6
=======================

   1) Corrected a bug in the memory allocation of pdir. Now malloc
      allocate the right size of memory (blocks of 512*allocblocks and not
      of 512 bytes !)

   2) A new switch -s for a short listing with only filenames. This is very
      usefull for obtaining file names in scripts in a Unix environment.

      example:
                  # this program convert every file in a QL disk

                  for i in `qltools $device -s`
                  do
                          qltools $device $i > $i
                  done

Changes from 2.15 to 2.15.1
===========================

1) Code reformatted to give proper structuring, indentation etc.
2) Replaces all magic numbers (512) with GSSIZE.
3) More meaningful names in the disk header block.
4) Replace main parameters with argc and argv
5) Much renaming of globals - better names now.
6) Fixed bug in ZeroSomeSectors() which was actually doing nothing.

Changes from 2.15.1 to 2.15.2
=============================

1) More variables given meaningful names.
2) Usage() output reformatted for easier reading.
3) '-t' option added to usage() output.
4) Adjusted MAXALB to 12 from 6. This is the number of 512 byte sectors needed for a
   floppy cluster for the map. DD/ED need 6 * 512 while ED needs 3 * 2048 (or 12 & 512).
5) Added ED disks/image processing.

Changes from 2.15.2 to 2.15.3
=============================

1) More tidying up of the usage messages. Proper letter case etc.
2) Extracted common code from the three format routines to reduce duplication.
