** what is qltools ? **

       This is qltools, a simple tool for manipulating QL files.

** compiling qltools **

       cc -o qltools qltools.c

       under MSDOS and Turbo C: tcc -DMSDOS -o qltools qltools.c

** development **

Qltools was developed under linux 0.98, the free OS for i386 with gcc 2.2.2,
the gnu c compiler (also free). I use only PD and shareware software and
have not any problem. Since some software is better than some commercial
software. A reliable "pubblic domain workstation" costs only the money for the
hardware and is comparable with a commercial system.

** porting **

Since qltools is a portable program. It compile ok under:

       - linux (0.96c and gcc 2.2.2, 0.98pl1 and gcc 2.2.2d)

       - SUN 4 (Sparc Station 2, SLC and IPC, SparcServer 830 Multiprocessor)

       - HP9000/825 under HP/UX 7.00 and HP/UX 8.00

       - MS-DOS 5.0 and Turbo C++ 1.00

       and, but not compiled myself:

       - NeXT

       - RS3000

       - It compiles ok also on the Macintosh platform under the Think C
         environment provided you use libraries compiled with 4 byte ints
         and the 4 byte int option turned on (Roberto Avanzi).

         (for Mac related questions ask Roberto Avanzi at the e-mail address
         <gandalf@sabrina.dei.unipd.it>

       - A amiga port is possible with a BSD compatibility box and a raw
         drive device.
