qltools 2.7:

1. Internal (code) tidy up
2. Compiled with highest optimisation levels
3. displays file size on -l -w (or -l -W)

This version of qltools 2.6 :

1. Adds more sensible error messages when a sector is unreadable

2. Correctly handles 'XTcc' data blocks on type 1 QDOS files.

v2.5 of qltools

1. Fixed corruption of files written to DOS_LIKE systems
   (MSDOS,OS2,NT) caused by the output files being opened in text
   mode.

2. Writes zero bytes to the first 18K of the disk in an attempt
   to prevent MSDOS from finding a secondary FAT.


The manual is unchanged from "docs/qltools24.readme".

The source code for qltools for all supported platforms (Unix,
NT/Win95, OS2, MSDOS) is available in the linux archive.
(qltools27.tgz)

The most recent DOS/OS2/Win95/WinNT code is cross compiled with
gcc. This allows long file names on W95 floppies. If you're running it
under DOS, you need a DPMI server. The enclosed CWSCPMI.EXE will
suffice; it needs to be on your PATH. Windows and OS2 provide DPMI
services.
